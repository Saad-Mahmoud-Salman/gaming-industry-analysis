ðŸ“Š Exciting Project Analysis â€“ Video Game Sales Dataset ðŸŽ® 

I'm excited to share my latest data analysis project, developed as part of my journey through the Information Technology Institute (ITI) scholarship. This project, focused on over 16,000 video games sold worldwide, spans from 1980 to 2020, offering an in-depth look at the gaming industryâ€™s performance across platforms, genres, and regions.

Key Findings:
ðŸ”¹ Global Trends:

Action, Sports, and Shooter games dominate worldwide sales, showing a clear preference for genres with broad, enduring appeal.
PS2 stands as the best-selling platform of all time, showcasing the power of a strong game library and long market presence.
ðŸ”¹ Regional Insights:

North America favors shooters and action games, while Europe aligns closely with global trends but shows a slight preference for racing games.
Japan stands out with a preference for Role-Playing Games and handheld devices like the Nintendo 3DS.
ðŸ”¹ Publisher Influence:

Industry giants such as Nintendo and Electronic Arts dominate key genres like platformers and sports, while Activision and Take-Two Interactive lead in high-revenue genres such as shooters and action.
Thereâ€™s an emerging opportunity for publishers to tap into less competitive genres like Adventure and Strategy, where innovation could create new market footholds.
What I Learned:
This project sharpened my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize complex datasets, while also deepening my understanding of how data-driven insights can drive strategic decisions in industries like gaming.
